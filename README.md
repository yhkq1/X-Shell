## Overview

X Shell is a PowerShell-based reverse shell that leverages a Discord server as its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. It dynamically creates dedicated Discord channels for each user, enabling organized command execution and response tracking.

## Features

- üîí Stealthy PowerShell dropper mechanism
- ü§ñ Discord-based command and control
- üîê Dynamic channel creation for each session
- üåê Remote script retrieval via API

## Architecture

### Components

1. **PowerShell Dropper**
   - Bypasses Windows execution restrictions
   - Retrieves main script from remote API
   - Minimal footprint for evasion

2. **Backend API**
   - Authenticates and serves scripts
   - Manages script deployment
   - Provides secure script retrieval

3. **Discord C2 Server**
   - Manages communication channels
   - Executes received PowerShell commands
   - Returns command output

## Security Considerations

- Implement strict authentication
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Monitor and log all activities
- Ensure compliance with legal standards
